<p align=center><b>Overview</b></p>

App Tracker is a tool for organizing your apps based on usage history.  It maintains a running tally of which 
apps you use the most and how recently you invoked them.  Using this, you can set up widgets that display your 
favorite apps, recently used apps, recently installed apps, etc.

<p align=center><b>Homescreen Widget</b></p>

To invoke the widget, long-press on the homescreen, choose "Widgets," then choose "App Tracker," and 
then set the configuration options. 
Feel free to put multiple widgets on the same screen.

<p align=center><b>Standalone Application</b></p>

The standalone app allows you to view 
all tracked applications and sort them by different statistics. 
You can also exclude, launch, or uninstall 
apps in the main list by touching them.

<p/>To manage your excluded  
apps (for instance, commonly used apps like the Dialer and Browser), 
hit Menu, Settings, and then Apps to Exclude. 

<p align=center><b>Sorting</b></p>

<p/>App Tracker offers six ways to sort your data - 
Recently Used, Most Used, Rarely Used, Recently Installed, Recently Updated, and Flavor of the Week. 
Most are pretty intuitive, but Flavor of the Week 
merits some explanation.    

<p/>Flavor of the Week can be thought of as a balance between Recent and Most Used.  Basically, an app's score is initially based 
on its number of hits, but its score starts to "decay" the longer you don't use it. You can also think of it as a kind of 
"Billboard Top 100" view.

<p/>Using the Time Decay Constant setting, you can dial up or down how fast app scores decay. 
Lower values mean they decay more quickly. 
If you're curious about how it works, here is the update function that gets periodically applied to the scores: 

<p/><font face="Courier New">update(s) = 
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s*<i>e</i><sup>(t'-t)/(-c*86400000)</sup></font>

<p/>...where <font face="Courier New">update()</font> is the update function, <font face="Courier New">s</font> is the score, 
<font face="Courier New">t'</font> is the current time (in milliseconds), 
<font face="Courier New">t</font> is the time of the last update, 
<font face="Courier New">c</font> is the decay constant, and 86400000 is the number of milliseconds in a day.  

<p/>The default decay constant is 7, meaning that an app that was accessed 7 
days ago will have its score decay to about 1/<i>e</i> (~0.3679).  Hence, "Flavor of the Week."

<p align=center><b>FAQs</b></p>

<p/><i>What's with the notification?</i>

<p style="margin-left:5pt">App Tracker uses a lightweight background process to monitor 
app usage. However, the Android system tends to be hostile to background processes 
unless they have an associated notification.  So if you disable the 
notification, Android might occasionally kill the process without giving it a chance to 
recover. This would cause App Tracker to stop tracking until a scheduled restart.</p>

<p style="margin-left:5pt">This situation mostly applies to older phones with limited resources, though. So if you 
have a high-end Android device (Droid, EVO, N1, etc.), then you can probably get away with 
disabling the notification. But if you're not sure, I recommend leaving it on.</p>

<p/><i>Why don't the widget icons align with the native icons?</i>

<p style="margin-left:5pt">If you look at the additional information that has to be 
fit into the widget (like the navigation buttons and the app subtext), you'll see that 
there's no way to make the icons line up with the native ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:5pt">And even if the user chooses 
to hide that information, it can't work consistently across all Android phones.  Different Android 
phones have different Launcher apps (e.g. Google vs. HTC, HelixLauncher vs. Cyanogen), so there's 
no way (AFAIK) to make a widget that will exactly fit all of them.</p>
